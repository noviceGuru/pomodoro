# Pomodoro

A timer with breaks, to boost your efficientcy.

The difference between this and other web apps is that this one lets you go overtime, and will register the time that you have worked/rested.

I made this because every person has different optimum time to focus and rest. This time changes over time. The main goal is to increase it to somewhere around 50 minutes. With this timer, you can gradually increase your focus time, and monitor all the changes.

## Background

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#cite_note-Cirillo-1) is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
