# Pomodoro

A timer with breaks, to boost your efficientcy.

## Background

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#cite_note-Cirillo-1) is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
